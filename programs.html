						A shocking 17.7 million children in India are out of school. Working in hazardous conditions,
						living on the street, braving hunger, poverty and violence, childhood for them has become an
						endless struggle to survive.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						But despite their circumstances, they have not stopped dreaming. Their dreams are as colourful
						as any other child’s and they have just as much potential to fulfil them. What they lack is a fair
						chance – an opportunity to go school, to hone their talents, to even have a happy and carefree
						childhood that every child deserves.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The Mission Education programme of Redemption identifies such out-of-school children
						from remote villages, tribal areas and urban slums, and provides them quality education. 
						In addition to this, it also looks after their health, nutrition, and holistic development
						through participation in co-curricular activities.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						This year, 22,000 children across 20 states of India were directly provided education through
						152 Mission Education projects. Leaving behind their circumstances, these children took the 
						first step towards a bright future.

						The current health scenario of the general population of India is a sad one. According to The
						Lancet a new index developed to assess each country’s achievement on a range of health
						indicators, India ranks at 154 in a list of 188 countries. A staggering 70% of the population
						still lives in rural areas and has no or limited access to hospitals and clinics.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To take healthcare to the poorest of the poor and to the remotest of places Redemption
						initiated a unique delivery modal with practical mechanism called 'Hygiene on Wheels'. Hygiene on 
						Wheels is a unique mobile hospital programme that seeks to address problems of mobility, 
						accessibility and availability of primary healthcare with a special focus on children and women, in
						urban slums and remote rural areas.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						More than 10 lakh children and families have benefitted so far from the free healthcare
						services provided through the Hygiene on Wheels programme.

						Various studies, as well as our experience, have shown that when we work towards women
						empowerment, the whole society benefits. But unfortunately in India, far from being 
						empowered, most women are denied even their basic rights like health, education, employment
						and a respectable status in society.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						'Swabhiman', meaning self-respect in English, is specifically aimed at realization 
						of both individual and collective self-esteem and inner strength for marginalised and socially
						excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						A tailor-made strategy called the ‘4 S Model’ has been developed under Swabhiman for women
						empowerment. The ‘4 S Model’ is an acronym for four novel approaches, namely Seeking
						Healthcare as a Behaviour, Support for Education, Supporters through Male Involvement,
						and Sustaining the Change in Communities. The programme identifies adolescent girls and
						women from the community and develops them into Change Agents, who in turn actively 
						contribute to the community mobilization process.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So far, Swabhiman has successfully made a difference to the lives of over 500,000 women
						and girl children.

						Redemption tackles acute malnutrition using an integrated nutrition strategy. 'Eradicate Hunger'
						consists of an approach which combines the assessment of nutritional status of children, 
						treatment of acute malnutrition, and prevention of all forms of malnutrition.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Our assessment, treatment and prevention activities are designed and carried out together
						with communities and health services. Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM)
						and with a medical condition are treated in intensive-care inpatient facilities known as
						Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres. These hospital-like centres required children and their
						parents or caregivers to remain in residence during their month-long treatment.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The recent development of innovative food products for treating severe acute malnutrition,
						known as Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTF), now permits treatment to take place in the
						community at any time and place, resulting in a shift towards new outpatient treatment
						programmes.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Such programmes, known as Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition, offer severely
						malnourished children the opportunity to be treated at home, rather than in a centre, with 
						family and community support for recovery.  Health professionals assist communities to
						diagnose nutritional problems, and oversee community-level activities.
